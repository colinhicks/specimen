        <p>What does it look like to transform a stream with ksqlDB, then repartition it into a new one? Press Play to find out. Hover over any event to see its contents. Drag the progress bar back and forth to how things change over time.</p>

    <p>Pretty cool! But what is really going on here? Let's slow things down and take it apart.</p>

        <h2>Step 1: Declare a stream</h2>
        <p>This animation is backed by a JavaScript library. The deal is that you give it the graph of your Kafka data and stream processing topologies, and it draws what happens if you execute it by using an (extremely limited) Kafka Streams JavaScript runtime.</p>

        <p>Here is what the code looks like. Make a <i>Specimen</i> by choosing a DOM element to render into and supply any customized styles. Then add a source stream. The records in each partition reflect the data that an underlying Kafka record would have.</p>

        <pre class="narrative-code"><code class="lang-javascript">
  const s = new Specimen(container, styles);

  s.add_root({
    name: "orders",
    kind: "stream",
    partitions: [
      [
        { key: "buyer-1", value: { amount: 40, country: "usa" }, t: 22 },
        { key: "buyer-2", value: { amount: 41, country: "eth" }, t: 45 },
        { key: "buyer-1", value: { amount: 42, country: "usa" }, t: 73 }
      ],
      [
        { key: "buyer-3", value: { amount: 42, country: "mex" }, t: 11 },
        { key: "buyer-4", value: { amount: 43, country: "eth" }, t: 38 },
        { key: "buyer-4", value: { amount: 41, country: "eth" }, t: 57 },
        { key: "buyer-3", value: { amount: 40, country: "mex" }, t: 60 }
      ],
      [
        { key: "buyer-5", value: { amount: 41, country: "arg" }, t: 24 },
        { key: "buyer-5", value: { amount: 42, country: "arg" }, t: 43 },
        { key: "buyer-6", value: { amount: 43, country: "mex" }, t: 67 }
      ],
      [
        { key: "buyer-7", value: { amount: 43, country: "arg" }, t: 19 },
        { key: "buyer-8", value: { amount: 40, country: "usa" }, t: 38 },
        { key: "buyer-9", value: { amount: 42, country: "usa" }, t: 42 },
        { key: "buyer-9", value: { amount: 44, country: "usa" }, t: 55 },
        { key: "buyer-7", value: { amount: 41, country: "arg" }, t: 53 }

        <h2>Step 2: Transform the stream</h2>
        <p>Derive a new stream from the existing one. Create a new node in the graph for the query, and another for its output stream. The supplied query text doesn't do anything -- it's just to be explicit about how to format it during rendering.</p>

    <div id="coloring">
      <div>
        <h2>Step 3: Control the color scheme</h2>
        <p>In the first example, the colors of the events change as they pass through the first persistent query to signify that they are being transformed. Specimen lets you bend appearances as part of its API. Amend the previous bit of code to include a <i>style</i> parameter to select the fill. The fill is chosen by hashing some of the record data against the partition count, supplied as part of a larger map of runtime context.</p>

        <h2>Step 4: Repartition the stream</h2>
        <p>Lastly, repartition the derived stream. Just supply a <i>partition_by</i> function. When you choose the partition, you get to see the row pre-processing as well as post-processing. This "before/after" model is pervasive in the API, and is highly useful for making complex animations.</p>
