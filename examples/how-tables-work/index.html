    <h1>Understanding how real-time materialized views work with ksqlDB</h1>

    <p>All around the world, companies are in chorus asking the same question: what is happening <em>right now</em>? We are inundated with pieces of data that have a fragment of the answer. But by the time we have assembled them into one clear view, the answer often no longer matters. It is too late.</p>

    <p>Stateful stream processing is the way to beat the clock. Itâ€™s a programming paradigm for materializing views of data in real-time. What does that mean? You ask questions whose answer is incrementally updated as new information arrives, meaning your queries will always be fast.</p>

    <p><a href="#">ksqlDB</a>, the event streaming database, makes it easy to build real-time materialized views over Kafka. But how does it work? In part 1 of this series, we looked at how stateless operations work. The subject of this post is stateful ones. If you like, you can follow along by executing the example code yourself. <a href="#">ksqlDB's quickstart</a> makes it easy to get up and running.</p>
